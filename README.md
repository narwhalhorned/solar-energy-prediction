# LSTM-Based Time Series Analysis for Solar Energy Forecasting

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and time series analysis to forecast solar energy production. The dataset used for this analysis, sourced from Kaggle's [Solar Energy Production dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivnlee/solar-energy-production), contains 258,423 rows of solar energy generation data. The primary aim of this project is to develop a robust forecasting model that utilizes historical solar energy production data to predict future energy output.

**Key Objectives:**
- Apply time series analysis techniques to understand patterns and trends in the solar energy data.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset to prepare it for LSTM model training.
- Implement LSTM-based neural networks for accurate and efficient energy production forecasting.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2).
- Create visualizations to illustrate the accuracy of the LSTM forecasts and validate the model's predictions against actual data.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Data Analysis and Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for code development and documentation
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub (for project collaboration and version control)


**Results:**
The project aims to provide accurate and reliable solar energy production forecasts, which can have real-world applications for optimizing energy distribution, consumption, and grid management.
